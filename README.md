ORBIT
=====

The repository aims at providing a placeholder for all outcomes developed in the framework of an EU-funded project, namely ORBIT - http://www.orbitproject.eu/.

ORBIT aims at ensuring business continuity by introducing a new cost-effective approach in virtualized infrastructures for providing application-agnostic high availability. Key to this direction is the consolidation of virtualized memory and I/O resources emerging from multiple physical hosts. To this end, the following main results are envisioned: 

Highly Available Consolidation of Virtualized Resources, building atop the concept of server virtualization to enable guest VMs to consume remote memory and I/O resources in a consolidated manner. 

Application Transparent Virtual Machine Fault Tolerance, improving the current solutions, which are either application speciÔ¨Åc, limited to Uni Processor workloads, lack required performance targets, or require propriety hardware, by providing a software-only solution that can be widely deployed on commodity hardware.

Metro-Area Zero Downtime Disaster Recovery, to improve business continuity by geographically distributed over a Metropolitan Area Network, whilst maintaining the desired KPIs of instantaneous fail-over with near-zero downtime, supporting business continuity even in light of major faults downing an entire site.
